    <div class="Condition">
        <h1>Here is the original explanation of this problem</h1>
        <p>There are five rational pirates (in strict decreasing order of seniority A, B, C, D and E) who found 100 gold
            coins. They must decide how to distribute them.
            <br>
            The pirate world's rules of distribution say that the most senior pirate first proposes a plan of
            distribution. The pirates, including the proposer, then vote on whether to accept this distribution.
            <br>
            If the majority accepts the plan, the coins are disbursed and the game ends. <strong>In case of a tie vote,
                the proposer has the casting vote</strong>.
            <br>
            If the majority rejects the plan, the proposer is thrown overboard from the pirate ship and dies, and the
            next most senior pirate makes a new proposal to begin the system again.
            <br>
            The process repeats until a plan is accepted or if there is one pirate left.
            <br>
            Pirates base their decisions on four factors:
            <br>
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Each pirate wants to survive.</li>
            <li>Given survival, each pirate wants to maximize the number of gold coins he receives.</li>
            <li>Each pirate would prefer to throw another overboard, if all other results would otherwise be equal.</li>
            <li>pirates do not trust each other, and will neither make nor honor any promises between pirates apart from
                a proposed distribution plan that gives a whole number of gold coins to each pirate.</li>
        </ol>



        <h2>New Condition</h2>
        <p>Now, in this new condition, <strong>"In the case of a tie vote"</strong>
            <br>
            The proposer will still be thrown into the sea.
        </p>

        <p>Then we should reconsider the questions. </p>
