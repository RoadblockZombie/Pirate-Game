      <h1>The Pirate Game is a classic "game theory" problem came out of last century. </h1>
      <p>The interesting problem has been used to explain some relationship of power. </p>
      <p>
        For example, in the mid century, the king, the landowner, and the public. 
        <br>
        In this situation, when the king dead, the landowner can take charge in the whole country. 
        <br>
        Thus, the king, who currently has the power, must prevent that unfortunate thing happen. 
        What can he do? 
        As the pirates in the problem, he will give "coins" to the pirate who will not directly benefit from his death. 
        Also, if the landowner finally controls the ower, that is, the "new king", he will also not give anything to the people who can take advantage after he dead.
